Reflection 0: The clusters reveal a clear trade-off: greedy approaches focused on minimizing makespan directly show promise, but other performance metrics suffer. Machine availability is a key factor in both high and low makespan scenarios. Iterative scheduling is a common feature. To improve, future heuristics should focus on incorporating balancing and separation considerations *during* the greedy makespan minimization process, rather than treating them as separate objectives. Hybrid approaches that occasionally deviate from pure greedy choices might unlock better overall performance.
