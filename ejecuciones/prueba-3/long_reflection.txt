Reflection 0: This set of heuristics prioritizes minimizing makespan by scheduling operations on the earliest available machine, factoring in job completion times and shorter processing times. This targeted approach demonstrates a strength in makespan reduction. However, without information on other cluster performances or previous long-term reflections, it's difficult to provide a truly synthesized reflection. A comprehensive strategy requires understanding how these heuristics impact separation and balance compared to other approaches, and whether the observed performance aligns with or diverges from past trends and insights.
