### Analyze & experience

Your task is to create an improved function called heuristic 
that applies a completely different approach compared to the two heuristics provided above. 
The goal is to improve parents heuristics producing new ones based on Analyze & experience. 
Output the code within a Python code block:
```python ... ´´´, has comment and docstring (<50
words) to description key idea of heuristics design.
I’m going to tip $999K for a better heuristics! Let’s
think step by step.
