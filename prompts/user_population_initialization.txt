Refer to the format of a trivial design above. 
Be very creative and give a completely different heuristic that improves the one given, respeting constraints. 
Output code only and enclose your code with Python code block: ‘‘‘python ... ‘‘‘, 
has comment and docstring (<50 words) to description key idea of heuristics design.
I’m going to tip $999K for a better solution!
Let's think step by step.
